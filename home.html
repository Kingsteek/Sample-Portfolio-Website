              <h2>A B O U T</h2>
                <p>As a sound cyber-security student, I am eager to learn and gain the essential skills to become successful in my field while adhering to my values of Leadership and Privacy. 
                These values shape my career sum up who I am and where I would like to see myself. One of my primary skills is Leadership, and I have always envisioned leading a team and 
                working alongside a group of people. Throughout my schooling years, I was always active in taking the role of a leader, and one of my notable roles was being the Head-Boy 
                of my school. I learned quite a lot from this spectacular experience, but the most significant one is learning about different personalities and their voices which shaped 
                who I am today. And to find happiness, fulfilment and value in living, I will lead a life centred around the principles of integrity, excellence and compassion because I 
                firmly believe these reflect my character. I also recognise my strengths and talents and develop them as a responsible person. I also tend to recognise and encourage others' 
                skills as I am the kind of person who seeks fulfilment when everyone around me becomes successful with and because of me. I want to provide myself with an opportunity to
                use my creativity and analytical skills to seek innovative solutions.</p>
